# Game Behavior

- Click spin button to see next result.

  - Clicking on the spin button will deduct a random bet from [10,20,30.......,100], player balance will reduce accordingly. ( can be seen under the logs )
  - As the spin result the new reel stop positions will be displayed on the bottom left of the screen, symbols on the reel will change accordingly.

  - In case of user win, winning details will display below the reel area ( replacing good luck msg ).
  - A quick rollup will play to the total win amount and will be placed right below the balance meter.
  - On roll up complete, balnce meter will update.
  - All the winning symbols start playing fade-in animation in a cyclic manner.

  - Handle insufficient balance, message is shown in place of Good Luck! message
  - Once the bet is reduced below the balance, player can place a bet again.
