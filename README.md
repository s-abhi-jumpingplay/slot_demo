  -On clicking the bonus button, it will add a transition and take us to the wheel screen.
  -On this screen we have a start button, clicking on it will make the wheel spin.
  -Weight table for the wheel is defined inside model.ts, using it a win will be decided and the corrosponding slice will land on the wheel pointer.

  - Celebration

    Amount on the wheel will countup to the slice value. at the same time coin shower will happen from top to bottom.
